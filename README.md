- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rosszc91


- ðŸ‘€ My goal is to build the ultimate business IT Framework in an incredibly intuitive, simple to understand, free of charge, step-by-step guide. 

Using the most cost-effective hardware, and using 100% Opensource software IT tools.

This entire project will be verified by individuals who are relevant to the IT industry or skillset and have agreed to speak on various aspects that they agree is best standards to the IT industry. 

My Goal is to show competency and transparency in order to build trust in the product itself, and my approach to this is ensuring all items are totally transparent with pictures, documents, and videos. With validated peer reviews, confirming best IT Standards, an average business owner will be able to follow this guide and build for themselves a fully functioning IT business that can be sold or used to cover all IT necessities in order to focus on the real goals.
